Example scene packages in this folder are designed for different render pipelines. Depending on the project render pipeline import one of those packages.

Each example scene is explaind in the Manual file (Documentation folder).


Note:
1) Universal and High Definition render pipeline example scenes require Unity 2019.3 or newer version.
2) After importing example scenes, Unity may not compile ShaderGraph files and print errors in the Console window. In this case manually open each ShaderGraph subgraph file and re-save asset. Unity will recompile shaders based on used RP version.
